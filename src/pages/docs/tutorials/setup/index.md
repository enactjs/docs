Enact provides a handy command-line tool (the [Enact CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@enact/cli)) that makes it easy to get started.

## Prerequisites

Before the Enact framework can function on your computer, it is necessary to install some software. The most important piece is the [Node JavaScript runtime](https://nodejs.org) version 10.10 or newer (you can check to see what version of Node is installed by typing `node --version` into your command prompt or terminal window).  If needed, follow the instructions on the site to install it.

## Installing Enact CLI

The Enact CLI provides a set of commands to ease creation, testing, maintenance, and packaging of your Enact-based apps. It can be installed globally on your system using `npm`:

```bash
npm install -g @enact/cli
```

Once installed, you can run `enact` from anywhere to run a command.

> We'll cover some of the available commands below but the [package README](https://github.com/enactjs/cli/blob/master/README.md) contains further detail.

## Enact App Structure

The first command you'll use is `enact create [<directory>]` to create a new application. The `[<directory>]` argument is optional and defaults to the current working directory. `create` creates the [initial directory structure](#directory-structure) and [configures the app](#configuring-the-application).

> **Note**: If you are developing an app for a webOS-based system (webOS TVs, [webOS OSE](https://www.webosose.org/), etc.) you can use the [`webostv`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@enact/template-webostv) template to create your application:
>
> ```bash
> enact template install @enact/template-webostv
> enact create -t webostv [<directory>]
> ```

### Directory Structure

The application directory includes:

* `README.md` containing some useful tips on creating and building your application,
* `package.json`, a file describing the application
* a `node_modules` directory containing all of your external dependencies (such as `@enact/core` and `react`)
* a `resources` directory containing localization files
* a `src` directory containing all your source files, both JS and CSS/LESS
* optionally, a `webos-meta` directory containing files necessary for webOS deployment

When you package your app, it will be placed into a `dist` directory.  You won't see this yet, but know that it's coming.

└── webos-meta (present if the `webostv` template was used to create the app)

	└── icon.png
```

### Configuring the Application

Your application is configured using the `package.json` file. We'll only cover the fields you most likely want to change here and leave a more [complete discussion of the `package.json`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/configuring-npm/package-json) for further reading.

* `"name"`, `"version"`, `"description"`, `"author"`, `"license"` - Application meta-data. These fields do not affect the build of your application but should be updated to reflect your application's details.
* `"enact"` - The Enact-specific configuration block(see [Enact Project Settings](https://enactjs.com/docs/developer-tools/cli/starting-a-new-app/#enact-project-settings) for further detail). By default, it contains intelligent defaults for an Enact Sandstone application. You *should* add a `"title"` field within this block to specify your application's title which will be included in the generated `index.html` during the build.

**package.json**

```json
{
	"name": "App",
	"version": "1.0.0",
	"description": "A general template for an Enact Sandstone application.",
	"author": "",
	"main": "src/index.js",
	"scripts": { [omitted] },
	"license": "UNLICENSED",
	"private": true,
	"repository": "",
	"enact": {
		"theme": "sandstone"
	},
	"eslintConfig": {
		"extends": "enact"
	},
	"eslintIgnore": [
		"node_modules/*",
		"build/*",
		"dist/*"
	],
	"dependencies": { [omitted] }
}
```

## Conclusion

With that housekeeping out of the way, nothing can stop you. You're ready to add your first source file and build Hello, Enact.
