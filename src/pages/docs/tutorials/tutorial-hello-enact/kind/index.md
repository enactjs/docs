In [Adding CSS](../adding-css/), we expanded our basic application with classes imported from a CSS Module.  Next up is [discussing stateless components](#stateless-components), why we consider them to be the foundation of any application and [introducing our factory](#introducing-code-classlanguage-textkindcode) for creating them, `@enact/core/kind`.

## Stateless Components

Both the power and utility of stateless components lies in their simplicity. They are merely functions that accept properties and return an element. That makes them [easy to understand](#understanding-a-stateless-component), very [testable](#testing-stateless-components) and easier to [optimize for rendering](#pure-functions).

### Understanding a Stateless Component

Since stateless components are primarily responsible for mapping properties to markup, they are usually very easy to follow. Most, if not all, you write will accept a single argument, `props`, which will provide all the external data you need. You may need to manipulate or adapt these properties and then inject them wherever they are required in the component.

The `const App` in the code example below is an stateless component.

### Testing Stateless Components

Because these components use only the `props` provided to create their markup, unit tests on those transformations do not have to worry about the internal state of the component or mock out complex external services.

### Pure Functions

Though not a requirement, stateless components should be designed as pure functions, which means that their output is only dependent upon the arguments provided and no external factors (e.g. external modules or impure language features such as `Date.now()`). If a function is pure, we can optimize its render process by caching the outcome for a given set of input `props`.

## Introducing `kind()`

Although creating a stateless component is itself a relatively straightforward process, there is an amount of boilerplate code that we felt could be safely and efficiently abstracted away behind a framework capability -- `@enact/core/kind`.

There are several features of `kind()` that you may find useful but we'll only introduce one here. The others will be covered as those features are added to our example application.

### Updating App.js

Here's the updated App module (`./src/App/App.js`) in its entirety:
```js
import kind from '@enact/core/kind';

import css from './App.module.less';

const App = kind({
	name: 'App',

	styles: {
		css,
		className: 'app'
	},

	render: function (props) {
		return (
			<div className={props.className}>
				Hello Enact!
			</div>
		);
	}
});

export default App;
export {App};
```

### `@enact/core`

We've divided the framework into a few discrete modules to make it easy to know where to find capabilities while only including what you actually use in your application. `@enact/core` contains the base capabilities necessary to build an Enact application, of which `kind()` is the most used.
```js
import kind from '@enact/core/kind'
```

### `kind()`

The `kind()` factory accepts an object that describes the component. 
```js
const App = kind({
```

#### Component Name

`name` is not required but recommended, as it makes both debugging and testing your component easier. By including it, you will be able to find your App's component in the [React Developer Tools](https://react.dev/learn/react-developer-tools) by name and find instances of it in testing frameworks like [enzyme](https://github.com/enzymejs/enzyme).
```js
name: 'App',
```

#### Style Handling

`styles` is an optional key that provides several useful features. First, it automatically joins classes sent (through `props.className`) from the containers of your components with the static classes you've defined for the component. In other words, if you wish to add a custom CSS class to a single instance of your component but want to retain the static class, you can achieve this by using styles with no extra code. Second, it automatically resolves classes to CSS module names if the `css` subkey is provided.

For our App component, we've configured `kind()` to resolve `'app'` to the locally-scoped class name in our CSS module, `css`, and concatenate it with the `className` provided to our component. The result of this concatenation is published in the `classes` property, which we'll see [demonstrated below](#rendering).

> `styles` will always apply the component classes *before* classes from props.
```js
styles: {
	css,
	className: 'app'
},
```
> **ES6 Object shorthand**
>
> You may have noticed that we've specified the `css` key without a value (or is it the value
> without the key?!?) in the object literal. We're taking advantage of an ES6 feature that allows
> you to pass a variable as an object property if the name of the variable matches the desired
> name of the key. So, by naming our CSS Module import `css`, we're able to pass it directly to
> `styles` without the extra key name (`css: css`).

> More information on object initialization can be found on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Object_initializer#New_notations_in_ECMAScript_2015)
> or in the [spec](https://262.ecma-international.org/6.0/#sec-object-initializer).

#### Rendering

The only required key is `render`, which expects its value to be the component itself. You'll notice that we're accepting a single argument, `props` and passing the `className` property from that object to the `className` property of the `<div>` DOM node.
```js
render: function (props) {
	return (
		<div className={props.className}>
			Hello Enact!
		</div>
	);
}
```
## Conclusion

While we didn't add much new functionality, we instead laid the groundwork for future features that will be enabled by the capabilities of `kind()`. We covered the benefits of stateless components and how to create them using the `kind()` factory. Next, we'll show how the styling and features of Sandstone can be easily added to our application.
