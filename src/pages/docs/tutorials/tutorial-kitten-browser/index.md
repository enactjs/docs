## Introduction
Before you begin this tutorial, make sure you have created a new Enact project.  See [Enact Development Setup](../setup/) for more information.  You can delete `src/views/MainPanel.js` as it will not be used in the tutorial example.

Kitten Browser is a tutorial that demonstrates many of the features of the Enact framework, ES6 and React that will be useful to you.  This is more in-depth than [Hello, Enact!](../tutorial-hello-enact/).
