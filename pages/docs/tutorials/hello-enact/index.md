title: Hello Enact!

Now comes the exciting part!  We're actually going to write some code and, maybe, learn a few things along the way.  We're going to break down the app into four parts.  They are:

1. [The Basics](basics/)
2. [Adding CSS](adding-css/)
2. [Introducing kind()](kind/)
3. [Adding Moonstone Support](adding-moonstone-support/)

(Don't worry, you can just start at step 1.  You don't have to come back here.  Each page has a link to the next section at the bottom.)
