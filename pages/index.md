title: "Enact"

Enact is a framework designed to be performant, customizable and well structured. The goal in
creating Enact was to build upon the experience gained in producing the Enyo JavaScript framework
and to incorporate the latest advances in JavaScript and Web engine technology. Enact is designed to
be used by both novice and expert developers.

## Why Enact?

### Ease of Use

Enact builds atop the excellent React library, and provides a full framework to the developer. The
recent boom of web technologies and related tools has led to a plethora of options available. In
fact, getting started might be the most difficult part of building a modern web application. Enact
allows developers to avoid this pain by providing an opinionated collection of libraries and tools
that have been thoroughly vetted to work well together.

### Performance

Beyond initial setup, Enact continues to provide benefits. It was built with performance in mind,
and conscious decisions were made to ensure that applications remain performant as they grow in size
and complexity. This ranges from the way components are rendered to how data flows through an
application. Having had experience developing a framework for low-powered devices, many learnings
from app launch time to view transition time have been integrated into the core of Enact and the
various widgets we provide out of the box.

### Customizability

Enact has a full set of customizable widgets that can be tuned and tweaked to the particular style
of each project. Using our experience in building full UI libraries for a broad swath of devices
ranging from TVs to watches, we have created a widget library whose components can easily be
composed to create complex views and applications.
